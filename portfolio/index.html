                <img src="images/portrait.PNG" alt="Portrait of Megan Brennan"/>
                <p>I am a <span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">
                    physicist and amateur software developer</span> from St. Cloud, 
                    Minnesota. I am also interested in data, education, and the 
                    environment. 
                </p>
                <p>I plan to attend the Software Guild in September 2020 to advance
                    my programming skills and start my career as a developer or engineer.

                <p>I graduated from Hamline University in 2019 with a Bachelor's in
                    Physics and a minor in Mathematics. I interned at Image Sensing
                    Systems where I worked on algorithms and data analysis in Python.
                    I am also <strong>self-taught in JavaScript and Java</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>From 2019-2020, I volunteered through <strong>AmeriCorps</strong> at Great Oaks
                    Charter School in Wilmington, Delaware. I tutored 12 high school 
                    freshmen in small groups for mastery of Algebra 1. I also focused
                    on teaching organizational and study skills to students and led 
                    student reflections on their performance.

                <img src="images/embroidery.jpg" alt="Embroidery of a stack of wood"/>
                <p>I enjoy fiber arts, particularly knitting and embroidery. I am
                    currently working on learning to knit socks. I also enjoy 
                    embroidering small patches. 
                </p>
                <p>I also enjoy walking, bicycling, and exploring local, state, and 
                    national parks.
